# Simple-InventoryStorageSystem

This is a very simple StorageSystem that can be used to store different boxes in this case. In the future this can be switched to different application based on who is using it. The code uses the idea of LinkedLists and node to create a storage system. Every box has a unique inventory number to keep track of it. Boxes stored in the list are. easily removed from the inventory list when needed.
There are differnt box colors which represent their importance on the chain.
  1) YELLOW boxes contain fragile things. They will always be/added to the head of the list. 
  2) BROWN boxes store heavy things. They will always be/added to the end of the list.
  3) BLUE boxes store non-fragile less heavy things. They will always be/added after the Yellow boxes but before the Brown boxes.
